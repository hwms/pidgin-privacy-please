pidgin privacy please is a pidgin plugin to stop spammers from annoying you.

It offers the following features:

 * Block individual users (with an optional auto-reply)
 * Block messages from people who are not on your contact list (with an optional auto-reply)
 * Suppress repeated authorization requests


== Auto-reply on blocked messages ==

On pidgin 2.5.0 (or newer) you can optionally have an auto-reply message sent to people when their messages have been blocked.


== Messages from unknown people ==

You can block any messages from people who are not on your contact list and
optionally have an auto-reply sent, telling them to request your authorization
first. Just check the corresponding options in the configuration dialog.


== Authorization requests ==

On recent pidgin versions, you can have repeated authorization requests
suppressed by the pidgin privacy please plugin. After enabling that option,
make sure to have "Block only the users below" selected in pidgin's privacy
dialog. Then, whenever you deny an authorization request, the sender is
automatically added to that list. For protocols where the user name does not
tell you anything about the actual person behind it (eg. ICQ) there is also
an option to have the user information pop-up automatically shown whenever
somebody asks for your authorization.
