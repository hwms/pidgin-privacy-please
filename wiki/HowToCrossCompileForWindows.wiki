= Introduction =

This page explains how to cross-compile the plugin for Windows. It was tested on Debian GNU/Linux "lenny".

Most of the information comes from http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/BuildingWinPidgin

= Install the required packages =

{{{
  # apt-get install mingw32 mingw32-binutils mingw32-runtime nsis 
}}}

= Prepare the build environment =

Choose a directory to build the plugin in. In this example, we'll use ~/tmp/build

{{{
  $ export BUILDDIR="~/tmp/build"
  $ mkdir $BUILDDIR && cd $BUILDDIR
}}}

Now, get and the pidgin windows build fetcher script:

{{{
  $ wget http://gaim-extprefs.sf.net/winpidgin-build-fetcher.sh
  $ sh winpidgin-build-fetcher.sh
}}}

The script might ask you a few questions, this is how you should answer (the suggested pidgin version might differ on your system):

{{{
  Do you want to prepare a Pidgin build environment in /tmp/build? [y/n] y
  Do you want to download a source package? [p/n] p
  What version of the Pidgin source would you like to download? [2.5.1] <enter>
  Do you want to delete temp files used to set up the build environment? [y/n] n
}}}

Now extract the plugin (again, pidgin and plugin versions might differ):

{{{
  $ cd pidgin-2.5.1/pidgin/plugins/
  $ tar xzvf ~/pidgin-privacy-please-0.5.2.tar.gz
}}}
