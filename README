gaim-blocky is a gaim plugin to stop spammers from annoying you.

It offers the following features:

	- Block certain users (with an optional auto-reply)
	- Block messages from people who are not on your contact list
	  ((with an optional auto-reply)
	- Suppress repeated authorization requests (only on gaim 2.0beta7+)


Blocking users
--------------

To block a user, all you have to do is append "   " (three spaces) to their
alias. Optionally you can have an auto-reply message sent to them whenever
they try to bother you.


Messages from unknown people
----------------------------

You can block any messages from people who are not on your contact list and
optionally have an auto-reply sent, telling them to request your authorization
first. Just check the corresponding options in the configuration dialog.


Authorization requests
----------------------

On recent gaim versions, you can have repeated authorization requests
suppressed by gaim-blocks. After enabling that option, make sure to have
"Block only the users below" selected in the gaim privacy dialog. Then,
whenever you deny an authorization request, the sender is automatically added
to that list.
