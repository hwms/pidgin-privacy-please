gaim-blocky is a gaim plugin which lets you block messages from certain
contacts in a protocol-independent way. Its code is based heavily on gaim-bs
(http://gaim-bs.sourceforge.net/) by David Everly.

To block a user, all you have to do is append "   " (three spaces) to their
alias. Optionally you can have an auto-reply message sent to them whenever
they try to bother you.
