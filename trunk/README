pidgin privacy please is a pidgin plugin to stop spammers from annoying you.

It offers the following features:

  - Auto-reply to to blocked messages
  - Block messages from people who are not on your contact list
    (with an optional auto-reply)
  - Suppress repeated/all authorization requests
  - Automatically show user info on authorization requests
  - Block jabber headline messages (eg. alerts from the MSN transport)


Auto-reply on blocked messages
------------------------------

You can have an auto-reply message sent to people whose messages have been
blocked to prevent accidentally blocked messages from disappearing unnoticed.


Messages from unknown people
----------------------------

You can block any messages from people who are not on your contact list and
optionally have an auto-reply sent, telling them to request your authorization
first. Just check the corresponding options in the configuration dialog.


Authorization requests
----------------------

In order to suppress repeated authorization requests, make sure that pidgin's
privacy options are set to "Block only the users below" since this is where
the plugin keeps track of request senders. Any other setting might lead to
utter chaos and unpredictible results, use at your own risk.

For protocols where the user name does not tell you anything about the actual
person behind it (eg. ICQ) there is also an option to have the user information
pop-up automatically shown whenever somebody asks for your authorization.

Or, if you already have all the friends you need, you can also have all
authorization requests rejected automatically (note that, depending on the
protocol, you might still be asked for a reason for rejecting).
