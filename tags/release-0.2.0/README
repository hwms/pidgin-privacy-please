gaim-blocky is a gaim plugin which lets you block messages from certain
contacts in a protocol-independent way. Its code is based heavily on gaim-bs
(http://gaim-bs.sourceforge.net/) by David Everly.

To block a user, all you have to do is append "   " (three spaces) to their
alias. Optionally you can have an auto-reply message sent to them whenever
they try to bother you.

Also, you can block any messages from people who are not on your contact list
and optionally have an auto-reply sent, telling them to request your
authorization first.
